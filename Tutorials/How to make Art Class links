Method 2:

-> A guide on how to BYOD (Bring Your Own Domain) to Art Class.
-> The guide below assumes youâ€™re attempting to link a FreeDNS subdomain to Art Class.

1. Open https://freedns.afraid.org and any temp mail provider. For example, https://mail.tm.
2. Click on the generated email to copy it.
3. Go back to FreeDNS and click "Sign Up Free".
4. Fill out the required information. First and last name doesn't have to be real but make sure to enter a User ID and password you will remember. Agree to the terms and conditions and send the account activation email.
5. Return to the temp mail provider you're using and refresh if the email doesn't automatically show up.
6. Open the email, copy the activation URL and paste it into a new tab.
7. Click "Registry" on FreeDNS.
8. Find a domain you want and click it.
9. Make sure A is selected. For the subdomain, enter anything you want. This will be what's before the domain (subdomain.domain.com). The destination should be 193.26.115.218.
10. Complete the captcha and save your changes.
11. Wait a few minutes, then go to the subdomain you created.

WARNING: Your link will stop working soon after as your account will be terminated.
