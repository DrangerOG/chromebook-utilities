With CorkGuardian, you can freeze GoGuardian!

Instructions:
1. Turn off your Wi-Fi.
2. Sign out.
3. Sign back in
4. Open a new tab without restoring your old tabs.
5. Rapidly click on the GoGuardian extension until it turns dark grey.
6. Turn your wifi back on.
7. Have fun browsing anything you want.

Notes:
This only bypasses GoGuardian!
Any other blockers (like LightSpeed) or network blocks aren't bypassed. 
This works on at least v122. Signing out again will remove the blocks, and you have to do the process again.
