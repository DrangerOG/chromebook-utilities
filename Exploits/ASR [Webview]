ASR Webview:

Notes:
-> Unlike myViewboard WhiteBoard, this app was force-installed without any way to uninstall it. 
-> I knew that this app had to have a webview somewhere. I've tried finding it for quite a bit but couldn't find any... but I found it now! At 11:00pm...

Instructions:
1. Install ASR if you don't have it: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.asr&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_medium%3Dhome-page
-> If you can't, you can't do this exploit.
2. Open ASR.
3. Click the 3 dots icon at the top right.
4. Click Settings.
5. After the settings window opens, click the Cloud Services section.
6. Click the green + Add button at the bottom right.
7. Click OneDrive/Business.
8. Click the green Connect to the service button.
9. A Microsoft sign-in screen will appear... (yep, you know what happens now)
10. Click Sign-in options.
11. Click Sign in with Github.
12. Click the Github logo.
13. In the search box at the top right, type Google.
14. Click Search all of Github.
15. Click the Google link in the infobox about Google to the right of the screen.
16. You are in Google and all websites are unblocked!
17. As there are no tabs, use the forward and back keys on the top row of your keyboard.
