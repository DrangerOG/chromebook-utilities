Corrupt extensions with the Corkey exploit!

Steps:
1. Do Esc + Refresh + Power on your chromebook and re-enroll (Enter recovery page) or you can just powerwash.
2. Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off WiFi and do refresh + power too (instant restart).
3. Log back into your Chromebook with the WiFi off. Look for an option to log in as an existing user and click that.
4. Go to chrome://extensions, turn on WiFi, and wait for your school's blocking extension to appear.
5. As soon as it appears, turn off WiFi and restart as fast as possible.
6. Log back in, go back to extensions, and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted 
or doesn't appear at all, then it worked (wait at least a minute with a close watch in case it comes back)
7. If it didn't work, start over. You have to be fast.
8. If it did work, you could go onto anything.

Notes:
This will wipe your local data including everything under "My files" due to the powerwash. Make sure to back up data to your drive.
