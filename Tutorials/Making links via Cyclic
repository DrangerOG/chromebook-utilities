Making links via Cyclic:

Preparation:
Link: https://app.cyclic.sh/api/app/deploy/`repositoryname`
The repository name filler should be replaced with one of the following of your choice (you can find your own too):
-> Interstellar: InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar
-> Snorlax's Cave: Snorlaxs-Cave/Snorlaxs-Cave-v2
-> Art Class: art-class/v4
-> Utopia: UtopiaUnblocker/Utopia
-> Abyss Web: AbyssServices/Abyss-Web
-> Astroid: VyperGroup/astroidv3
-> Shuttle: shuttlenetwork/shuttle
-> Tinf0il: Aluminum-Depot/Tinf0il-new
-> Doge Unblocker: dogenetwork/v4
-> Shadow Tabbed: https://github.com/xnightless/Shadownetwork

1. Go to https://app.cyclic.sh/
2. Login with Github, sign up with github if you don't have an account.
3. Go to the link you created when preparing.
4. Follow the instructions on the webpage. If it has the error "Unauthorised," make sure to sign in with github on step 1.
5. Press "Connect". You will need to confirm it with github.
6. Continue following the directions, it's pretty straightforward, and the deployed link will be at the bottom once you finish!
