Unfortunately, minesraft2 was ceased and desisted by Blooket (and got terminated from Github). 05konz would back it up with permission from minesraft2 and then proceed to start making updates for the project.
Unfortunately, 05konz got terminated from Github, likely for the same reason as minesraft2. Here's a backup of his version on Github (this is NOT updated):

NOTE: YOU CAN FIND 05KONZ'S VERSION ON GITLAB NOW. THEY UPDATE IT THERE:
