These are some youtube video links that might be able to unblock restricted videos on your school account:

VIDEOIDHERE should be the youtube video id, a 11 character string unique to every video that's the second half of all youtube links.

Example:
Here's the two main formats of youtube links...
https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
In this case, the video id would be dQw4w9WgXcQ.
