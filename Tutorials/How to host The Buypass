This tutorial covers everything you need to do (and know) to host your version of The Buypass.

- What you need to know:

  > First, you probably shouldn't host your version of The Buypass on Vercel 
    (though it is very tempting).
    To learn more, see https://github.com/bypassiwastaken/buypass/issues/11

  > Potential drawbacks of The Buypass

      *  It only lasts for 3 minutes!
      *  Pages visited in this window will not be saved to your history, but their cookies will be saved.
      *  You can right-click on the window to go back and forward.
      *  There's no good way to make the text in the window larger.
      *  This won't bypass network filters.
      *  You can't log into non-school accounts.
      *  It's completely possible that some filters could read and block the data sent within the window.

- How to host your version:

  > First, I recommend thoroughly reading the section that covers what you need to know.

  > Second, log on to Replit or Netlify.
    If you don't already have an account, create one.

  > Third, open a new tab and type `view-source:` and then the URL of any fixed exploit.
    Then, copy the HTML code.
    To view fixed exploits, see https://github.com/S-PScripts/chromebook-utilities/blob/main/Exploits/The%20Buypass

  > Fourth, do these steps (please note that you would follow these URLs for your preferred fixed website):

    *  First, you would download https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/favicon.ico
    *  Second, you would copy the code from https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/style.css
    *  Third, you would also copy the code from https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/script.js
    *  Fourth, you would also copy the code from the following files:

       ;  https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/payment-manifest.json
       ;  https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/pay/pay.json
       ;  https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/pay/sw.js
       ;  view-source:https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/pay/navigate.html
       ;  https://playful-meringue-fb58bc.netlify.app/pay/navigate.js

    *  This would be the directory tree for you:

       --- ./pay
         > | pay.json
         > | sw.js
         > | navigate.html
         > | navigate.js
         | ./favicon.ico
         | ./style.css
         | ./script.js
         | ./payment-manifest.json

  > Fifth, create a GitHub repo with the above directory tree inside it (in that directory tree ./ means main root directory)
    Then, deploy it to Netlify or Replit.
