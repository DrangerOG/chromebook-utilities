Skiovox (v124):

Notes:
This may not work for some people due to the patch.

Requirements:
-> Have "Log in as existing user" on the network not available page.

Instructions:
1. Sign out and turn off your wifi.
2. Open your kiosk app of choice and wait for the network page to show.

These next steps have to be fast:
3. Click Add network, quickly type in random letters and hit enter.
4. Quickly press Diagnose, Wifi, Open in Settings, and then press Close at the bottom right to exit out back to the wifi page.
5. As fast as you can, press Log in as existing user and sign in.
6. Close the school window in the top right and there should be an unblocked page behind it.
   This is an unblocked Skiovox container.
