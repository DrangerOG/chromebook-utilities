Making links via Vercel:
Link: https://vercel.com/new/clone?repositoryurl=`UNBLOCKERURL`

1. Replace the filler with an unblocker repository.
-> Interstellar: https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar
-> Snorlax's Cave: https://github.com/Snorlaxs-Cave/Snorlaxs-Cave-v2
-> Artclass: https://github.com/art-class/v4
-> Utopia: https://github.com/UtopiaUnblocker/Utopia
-> Abyss Web: https://github.com/AbyssServices/Abyss-Web

-> Shuttle: https://github.com/shuttlenetwork/shuttle
-> Tinf0il: https://github.com/Aluminum-Depot/Tinf0il-new

2. Log in to your vercel account with Github. Sign up if needed with Github (you will have to authorise).
3. In the "Create Git Repository," enter the repository name that will be linked to your unblocker. It can be anything.
4. Click "Create".
5. After a few moments, go to the link that you just created. It should be (repositoryName).vercel.app.
