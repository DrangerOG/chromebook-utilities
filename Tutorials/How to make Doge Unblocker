Method 2:
-> A guide on how to BYOD (Bring Your Own Domain) to Doge Unblocker.

1. Open https://freedns.afraid.org and any temp mail provider. For example, https://mail.tm.
2. Click on the generated email to copy it.
3. Go back to FreeDNS and click "Sign Up Free".
4. Fill out the required information. First and last name doesn't have to be real but make sure to enter a User ID and password you will remember. Agree to the terms and conditions and send the account activation email.
5. Return to the temp mail provider you're using and refresh if the email doesn't automatically show up.
6. Open the email, copy the activation URL and paste it into a new tab.
7. Click "Registry" on FreeDNS.
8. Find a domain you want and click it.
