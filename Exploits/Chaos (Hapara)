This works for Hapara Highlights and Hapara Filter as well as some other filters.

Notes:
-> This is a bypass method for certain web filters and monitoring software on school-managed Chromebooks.
-> This will ONLY work on Chrome OS devices that are logged into a managed account. 
-> It is also more complicated and tedious than the other entrypoint, and you should only use it if the other entrypoint doesn't work.
-> You need Inspect Element for this!

Instructions: 
1. Go to xlak.github.io/chaos.
2. Click the button.
3. You will now have a script in your clipboard.
-> I know that the website already has the instructions from here on but I'll say it anyway.
4. Paste the script in a new tab.
5. Right click and click "Inspect".
6. Click on the "Console" section at the top and paste the script again.
7. When an inspect window pops up, paste the script again.
