KIOSK Exploit

Although many variations of this exploit exist, this was the very original implementation of it. 
However, the process never went as far or flexible as a full Chrome browser window being able to be created out of this method rather than just a simple bypass within the KIOSK app.

This exploit allows you to open an unrestricted Chrome instance within a kiosk app, i.e. with the kiosk user account permissions.

Requirements:
-> Any kiosk app installed

Steps:
-> [for v77 to v85] OOBE/fresh install.
-> Sign out.
-> Turn Wi-Fi off.
-> Enable ChromeVox (CTRL+ALT+Z).
-> Open a kiosk app.
-> Spam Search+O+K (you do have to re-click O and K).
-> While spamming, click "Diagnose".

Notes: 
-> The exploit should work consistently v76 or below but it's still possible to pull off on v85 or below, but only once (right after you powerwash).
