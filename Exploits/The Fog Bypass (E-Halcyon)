Since this exploit is part of sh1mmer, you can read about it yourself on the official website here: https://fog.gay/.

UPDATE:
Since the website is now down (probably forever), you need to fork the source of the website here: https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/halcyon-website
After forking, host it on github pages.
