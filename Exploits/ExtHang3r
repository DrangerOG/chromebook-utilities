ExtHang3r is an exploit created by Blobby-Boi that allows ChromeOS users to kill managed extensions after the LTMEAT patch. It remains unpatched in all new ChromeOS versions as of June 2024.

This exploit works very similar to another exploit, Dextensify. The main difference is that instead of creating iframes and slowly getting rid of them, it creates a separate popup window that spams iframes and refreshes them.
After a few seconds, the popup is closed achieving similar behavior to the LTMEAT Flood method. 
The only problem is that for whatever reason this hang wouldn't let you disable the extension with the file URL's switch, but that can easily be fixed by just attempting to open any of the extension's pages (in this case, manifest.json).
