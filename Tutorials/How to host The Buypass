This tutorial covers everything you need to do (and know) to host your version of The Buypass.
 
What you need to know:
-> First, don't host your version of The Buypass on Vercel. It will not work.
-> Potential drawbacks of The Buypass
   It only lasts for 3 minutes!
   Pages visited in this window will not be saved to your history, but their cookies will be saved.
   You can right-click on the window to go back and forward.
   There's no good way to make the text in the window larger.
   This won't bypass network filters.
   You can't log into non-school accounts.
   It's completely possible that some filters could read and block the data sent within the window.

How to host your version:
1. Log on to Netlify. If you don't already have an account, create one by logging in with Github.
2. Go to this repo: https://github.com/S-PScripts/buypass
3. Fork the repo.
4. On Netlify, click on the sites section.
5. Click the blue "Add new site" button.
6. Click Import an existing project.
7. On step 1, "Connect to Git provider", click Github. You will need to authorise the Netlify app if you've never used Netlify before.
8. On step 2, "Select repository", find and select the repo you forked in the list.
9. On step 3, "Configure site and deploy", scroll down to the bottom and click the blue "Deploy" button.
-> You can set the site name to anything you want (under the Team dropdown, you can put anything in the Site Name box. Once you've done this, check for availability and if it's available you're set!
10. Wait until Netlify finishes deploying your site. If it doesn't end after a minute, reload and it should show as completed.
11. You're done! Go to the new link you created. Here's one I made: https://the-buypass.netlify.app/
