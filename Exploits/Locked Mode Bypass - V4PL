## Another Google Forms Locked Mode Bypass ##
This is for educational purposes only, use only on forms that you own
## How does this work?
So, you want to know how the genie does his tricks, eh?  Well, I'll tell you.
Google is dumb
They forgor to add any checks to make sure locked mode is actually enabled ðŸ’€
All that happens when you open a locked Google Form is that it submits a form via POST request that responds with the test (which would usually be locked, but we skipped the part where it tells Chrome to lock itself)
The token sent with the POST request is easily scraped from the form login page

## What potential is there for issues by using this?
Every time you make the POST request after the first time, Google emails the owner of the form
The form object on the page gets deleted when the "visibilitychanged" event is fired
2a. The "visibilitychanged" event is only fired by complete obfuscation, not partial or loss of focus.
You're screwed if you don't follow the directions.
