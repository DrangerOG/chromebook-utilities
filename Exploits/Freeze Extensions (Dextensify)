Main: https://dextensify.pages.dev/main

Extension manifest: chrome-extension://<extensionidhere>/manifest.json
Extension settings: chrome://extensions/?id=<extensionidhere>

Instructions:
1 Go to the extension settings page in a new tab.
2. Open Dextensify on another tab.
3. On the Dextensify page, click the "freeze extension" button. 
4. Immediately switch back to the chrome://extensions tab.
5. Back on the chrome://extensions page, spam the "allow access to file URLs" switch for a few seconds.
6. The extension should now be temporarily disabled. 
7. For this effect to persist, flip the "allow access to file URLs" again every few minutes, or if pages start getting blocked again.
8. You may also need to reopen this page every once in a while to prevent an unavoidable memory leak from crashing the system.

Notes:
During this process, your Chromebook may hang momentarily. This is normal, and it should resolve itself after a few seconds.
